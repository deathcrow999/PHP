# PHP

##Randomness

Im not sure wha im doing i just know im doing something...

##What im doing

So ive decided im going to just do stuff till stuff makes sense

like class and functions kinda stuff

Like class blah{
 var $blah;
 public function setName($newName){
  $this->name...
 }
}

So basically just php and oop and whatever idk im extremly bored and just messing around

##New decision
I might make this into like a tutorial thing but would anyone care? If you do fork the project ^_^
